                At first glance, The Medium is the Message seems to be trying to teach us that what we write/say in the media is inconsequential.
                I was quite happy to believe that this was McLuhan’s message because with the scale of the media today in its many forms (mostly TV and the internet), I can see how a single piece of content can be seen as a drop of water in an ocean.
                Even the biggest news stories, whether they are about war or a massive petrol price hike, are forgotten quite quickly. This conclusion began to fall apart when I realised that the reading was written in the 60s. 
                A time when newspaper and radio were still the largest forms of media and TV was only a little over 8 years old in Canada.
                It seems more like McLuhan was speaking on the power of the media themselves. As the media change and grow, the way we interact with information changes and grows as well.
                For example: When radio and newspaper were the main sources of information it was a little easier to trust the information you get. The newspaper came from a registered company with a CEO, management, and a building somewhere. Writing false information would have serious consequences for those people, so they were less likely to go buck wild printing lies on a weekly basis. The internet, on the other hand, allows for any person with an internet connection and an agenda to anonymously write garbage and post it as news. Many of us are aware of this and will take the information with a grain of salt. Some will even go as far as doing their own research to try and verify what they’re reading.
                Changes like this can affect far more than just how we interact with information. As the media grows to deliver more information faster or make information more easily available, we will begin to see the world around us differently.
                Consumers may choose their preferred products based on how these products are sourced (information which is usually readily available on the right websites). Education is made easier with more accessible information. Our pets may live longer because we don’t have to go to a vet to learn that you can’t just feed your dog anything. All this information was out there already for a long time. The media has just grown large enough to be able to deliver it all at any given time, and fast enough for it to be available to a lot more people
                This change in how we view information is entirely due to changes in the medium. The content itself has no effect on how we process it. 
                It is to my understanding that McLuhan is trying to highlight that if we focus on the content too much, we fail to notice the effect of the medium on our lives.
