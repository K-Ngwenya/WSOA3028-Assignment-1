                <b> The Medium is the Message </b>
            </h1>
            
                <article id="blog-post-1">
                    <p>
                        At first glance, The Medium is the Message seems to be trying to teach us that what we write/say in the media is inconsequential. 
                        I was quite happy to believe that this was McLuhan’s message because with the scale of the media today in its many forms (mostly 
                        TV and the internet), I can see how a single piece of content can be seen as a drop of water in an ocean. Even the biggest news 
                        stories, whether they are about war or a massive petrol price hike, are forgotten quite quickly. This conclusion began to fall apart 
                        when I realised that the reading was written in the 60s. A time when newspaper and radio were still the largest forms of media and 
                        TV was only a little over 8 years old in Canada. 
                    </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        It seems more like McLuhan was speaking on the power of the media themselves. As the media change and grow, the way we interact with 
                        information changes and grows as well.
                    </p>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        For example: When radio and newspaper were the main sources of information it was a little easier 
                        to trust the information you get. The newspaper came from a registered company with a CEO, management, and a building somewhere. 
                        Writing false information would have serious consequences for those people, so they 
                        were less likely to go buck wild printing lies on a weekly basis. The internet, on the other hand, allows for any person with an internet 
                        connection and an agenda to anonymously write garbage and post it as news. Many of us are aware of this and will take the information with 
                        a grain of salt. Some will even go as far as doing their own research to try and verify what they’re reading. 
                    <p>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        Changes like this can affect far more than just how we interact with information. As the media grows to deliver more information faster or make information more easily 
                        available, we will begin to see the world around us differently. Consumers may choose their preferred products based on how these products 
                        are sourced (information which is usually readily available on the right websites). Education is made easier with more accessible information. 
                        Our pets may live longer because we don’t have to go to a vet to learn that you can’t just feed your dog anything. All this information was out 
                        there already for a long time. The media has just grown large enough to be able to deliver it all at any given time, and fast enough for it to be 
                        available to a lot more people This change in how we view information is entirely due to changes in the medium. The content itself has no effect 
                        on how we process it. It is to my understanding that McLuhan is trying to highlight that if we focus on the content too much, we fail to notice the 
                        effect of the medium on our lives.

                    <b>Semantic Markup</b>
                </h1>
                <article class="blog-post-2">
                    <p>
                        Semantic Markup seems to have many definitions that somewhat agree with each other. 
                        Most sources agree that it is a way of writing HTML that clearly defines the different 
                        sections and the layout of your website for both the user and the browser. Some examples 
                        of semantic elements in HTML are: &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;summary&gt;, 
                        and &lt;header&gt;.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Semantic markup can help you get your information to your target audience. 
                        By placing the right information in the right tags, you can establish a hierarchy that helps browsers 
                        know what your page is about. Now your webpage can be ranked according to its most important 
                        content and pulled up for relevant searches. Webpages without semantic markup are basically inaccessible 
                        to people with disabilities who would normally rely on assistive technologies to access information on 
                        the web. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A lack of semantic markup would also make your page inaccessible to people that use text 
                        browsers, browsers without stylesheets, and other tools or devices that rely on semantic markup. 
                        By using semantic markup, you make your information accessible to a lot more people. Developers also 
                        benefit from the use of semantic markup as it makes code easier to maintain in the long run. If 
                        another developer was to take over your project or simply read your code, they would find clear 
                        and well-structured code. This means no confusion, and no train smash if you decide to go on holiday 
                        and your website has an issue in your absence.

                    <b>The Use of Metadata</b>
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Metadata is data that provides information about other data. It helps to describe, sort, and identify pieces 
                    of information. For example, a book can have a title, an author, and a year published. This information is 
                    metadata. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Metadata comes in a few different flavours. The main three are Descriptive metadata, Administrative metadata, 
                    and Structural metadata.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Descriptive metadata helps us discover, identify, and select resources. Examples of this include titles, 
                    authors, keywords, and dates. This is the simplest and most utilized form of metadata.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Administrative metadata is all about control and preservation. It tells us what types of instructions, 
                    rules, and restrictions are placed on a file. This type of information is used to manage access to the 
                    information.  Examples of this are copyright information, owner and licensing information, and 
                    preservation activities. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Structural metadata is all about organization and, well, structure. It describes how components of 
                    data are organized and put together with other data. Examples of this are page numbers, sections, 
                    chapters, and indexes. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The purpose of metadata is to make finding the right information easier for the user and even 
                    though this sounds like an optional luxury, it is extremely important. Let’s try to imagine 
                    a world without metadata:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let’s imagine a library. Not an infinite one, just your regular public library. Your average 
                    public library can easily have over a thousand books. Now let’s remove all the covers, titles, 
                    bar codes, and blurbs from those books. Now if you wanted to find, say, a book on dentistry 
                    it would be extremely difficult. You would have to look inside every single book to figure out 
                    if it’s the book you want. You could get lucky and find it on the first, second, or third try 
                    but what if you don’t? What if you start on the opposite side of the library and the book you 
                    want is 350 books away? 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now imagine the same scenario in the context of the world wide web. Millions of articles, 
                    web pages, videos, and documents but no metadata. It would all be useless because you’d need 
                    to perform a ritual and sacrifice a goat every time you want to find something. So, unless 
                    you’re a wizard, you need metadata. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Metadata makes it possible for the user to find exactly what they are looking for quickly 
                    and efficiently. It also makes it possible for people who provide information to organise their work. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The preservation of knowledge also depends on metadata. Storing thousands of GB of data is 
                    great but how do we get pieces of it back out if we don’t know where those pieces are? 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The MEMEX, as proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945, would allow people to store and recall 
                    information with great speed and flexibility. Even this device would almost entirely on 
                    the use of metadata to organise, store, and recall data. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Metadata allows is useful in this way because it allows us to organise information based 
                    on certain pieces of data. Articles can be grouped together by author or year published. 
                    Web pages can appear together in a search because they have the same/similar titles. 
                    Information on 100 different topics can be found, neatly stored in a single 1000-page encyclopaedia. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Without it, information is a waste of time and space. Through doing research, I have 
                    developed a new sense of appreciation for Metadata. I may not have known about it a week 
                    ago, but now I know that I would not be able to live without it.
