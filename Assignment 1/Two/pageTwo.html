                    The image below is the wireframe for the website you are currently browsing. 
                    It is the second iteration. The first iteration will be discussed later. The 
                    goal of this current iteration is to provide full, easy access to everything 
                    on the website with the simplest design.
                </p>

                    This iteration features a side navigation bar. The decision to have a side 
                    navigation bar came about because I wanted to have a list of all the items 
                    available on a particular page. This would allow the user to simply click on 
                    the piece of information they are looking for instead of scrolling through 
                    a long page or having to navigate an endlessly unfolding collection of dropdown 
                    menus. Having it on the left feels natural and reduces the mouse travel distance 
                    between the menu and the refresh, back(arrow), and forward(arrow) buttons on 
                    the top left of the screen. Another advantage of this navigation bar is that everything 
                    you need is in one place, right in front of your eyes. Some web pages opt for a system 
                    where you select an item, which opens up another list of sub items to choose from. This 
                    can happen 2 or 3 more times before you find what you need. With this system, all your 
                    options, including the back button, are right there. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The section on the right-hand side of the page is where all the content and information will 
                    be displayed. Having a larger font size means makes the content easier to read. This 
                    compensates for the screen space I lose by having a fixed navbar on the left. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    At the bottom of the page you’ll find a space reserved for extra links and contact information. 
                    The only reason I have this is that it seems to be a convention. Most websites have this feature 
                    and whenever I need to find information about the company or the publishing of the website this 
                    is where I go. So just in case I am not the only one with these expectations, I have included it. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The entire website is divided into 3 simple sections. With these, the user has easy access to all 
                    the information they may need and they don’t have to jump through hoops to get it. This is 
                    sustainable if the website remains a simple portfolio page, but the navigation will most probably 
                    require a rework if more distinct types of information/data is added for the user’s perusal. Then 
                    I might have to do the whole drop down menu thing if I cannot find a way around it. I really hate 
                    dropdown menus.
