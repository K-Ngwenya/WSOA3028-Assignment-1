                        The image below is the wireframe for the website you are currently browsing. 
                        It is the second iteration. The first iteration will be discussed later. The 
                        goal of this current iteration is to provide full, easy access to everything 
                        on the website with the simplest design.
                    </p>

                        This iteration features a side navigation bar. The decision to have a side 
                        navigation bar came about because I wanted to have a list of all the items 
                        available on a particular page. This would allow the user to simply click on 
                        the piece of information they are looking for instead of scrolling through 
                        a long page or having to navigate an endlessly unfolding collection of dropdown 
                        menus. Having it on the left feels natural and reduces the mouse travel distance 
                        between the menu and the refresh, back(arrow), and forward(arrow) buttons on 
                        the top left of the screen. Another advantage of this navigation bar is that everything 
                        you need is in one place, right in front of your eyes. Some web pages opt for a system 
                        where you select an item, which opens up another list of sub items to choose from. This 
                        can happen 2 or 3 more times before you find what you need. With this system, all your 
                        options, including the back button, are right there. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The section on the right-hand side of the page is where all the content and information will 
                        be displayed. Having a larger font size means makes the content easier to read. This 
                        compensates for the screen space I lose by having a fixed navbar on the left. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        At the bottom of the page you’ll find a space reserved for extra links and contact information. 
                        The only reason I have this is that it seems to be a convention. Most websites have this feature 
                        and whenever I need to find information about the company or the publishing of the website this 
                        is where I go. So just in case I am not the only one with these expectations, I have included it. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The entire website is divided into 3 simple sections. With these, the user has easy access to all 
                        the information they may need and they don’t have to jump through hoops to get it. This is 
                        sustainable if the website remains a simple portfolio page, but the navigation will most probably 
                        require a rework if more distinct types of information/data is added for the user’s perusal. Then 
                        I might have to do the whole drop down menu thing if I cannot find a way around it. I really hate 
                        dropdown menus.

                        The image you see below is the style guide for this website. It contains all the colours, colour 
                        codes, and fonts used on the site. This combination of colours was chosen because I wanted to give 
                        the website a clean, yet warm look.

                    <p>
                        The white is what gives each website a clean look. I associate white with cleanliness and sophistication. 
                        It is also easy on the eye and allows me to use a black font without worrying about a colour clash or the 
                        text blending in too much. The very light pink/red brings a touch of warmth to the webpages. With this 
                        combination of clean white and warm pink I am hoping to create a comfortable place for the user to explore. 
                        Black is used for the buttons because I did not want to overuse the pink. I felt that black is a nice contrast 
                        to the white. I do have the buttons turning pink when you hover over them though, because I did not want to 
                        introduce another colour to the mix and if I just made them turn white the text would disappear.

                    <p>
                        In the beginning of the first block, I had a clear idea of what my website should look like. I knew that I 
                        wanted a side navigation panel and buttons that allow you to move from page to page. In this first idea, 
                        the navigation panel was on the right because I thought it would be more comfortable for users to read on 
                        the left-hand side of the page. I also wanted to have as many navigation options as possible (page buttons, 
                        search bars, navbar). 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        All of this changed when I made a web page just how I wanted it. I realized that having the navbar on the 
                        right feels awkward. Almost like it’s there because of a bug or something. Also, my portfolio website wouldn’t 
                        require a lot of different pages because I’m not going to have very many distinct types of information on 
                        the site. So having a million ways to find information, even though it sounds good, just clutters up the space. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With this realization I decided first to create a new wireframe. This new wireframe would have the navbar on the 
                        left (so much better) and have less navigation options. The user would now have the navbar to find all listed 
                        sections/pieces of information. That is all. The search bar doesn’t make sense because the website isn’t super 
                        populated. Imagine having a search bar for a website with 3-4 pages total. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I do realize that I may be underestimating the growth of information on the website. If the site does come to hold 
                        pages and pages of blog posts and projects then I may need to implement a search bar or some drop downs, but until 
                        then, this just makes sense. Actually, ever drop downs. I really don’t like drop-down menus. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Finding the best colour scheme was very difficult. I am not really great with colours so I started by using some of 
                        my favourites (greens, blacks, purples. This turned out to be pretty bad. It just looked terrible. Then I decided to 
                        have a look at some automotive company websites. These have always looked the best to me. I found that they mostly use 
                        whites, greys, silvers, and browns. This looked neat, clean, and was comfortable on the eye even when there are a million 
                        things on the screen at once. I decided to go for black and white. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once I had redone the colours on the site I felt that black and white was too little colour and I didn’t want it to look 
                        like I hadn’t done any work. Therefore, I started playing around with greys and browns on the background panels. This 
                        never looked quite right so I moved on to colours like beige and pink. The pink looked a lot better and added a little 
                        bit of warmth to the site. I liked it. That’s why the background of the page and the buttons (when you hover) are pink. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am feeling like the site is looking how I want it to, but I don’t know if it is enough. I hoped for maximum simplicity 
                        when I started but I didn’t think it would look so simple. When I start adding JS to the site I am hoping to make it look 
                        really great and interesting while keeping the same simple functionalities. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There were a few technical issues as well. If you check the little info and links section at the bottom of the page, you’ll 
                        notice that a third of it has wandered off under the navbar. I can’t seem to get it to come out from under there. I also 
                        have a little bit of side-to-side scrolling happening with the main section of the page. If you try to scroll left and right, 
                        it wiggles a bit and I can’t get it to sit still without freezing the entire page or messing up the positioning of the other 
                        element. I think all of the issues I had were positioning issues. It took me a while to figure out how to move the navbar 
                        from the right to the left. Online sources were not helpful either. Other than that I didn’t have too much trouble with the 
                        HTML and CSS.
